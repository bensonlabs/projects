# Projects: instructions for AI agents

<!-- Only the governance blocks below come from architectureOS; /sync-governance updates them. Everything outside them belongs to this project and is never changed by a sync. -->

<!-- BEGIN governance:scaffold -->
## How this file works

- **Personal preferences** of the person you're working with come from their own Claude settings
  (their user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), never from this file.
- **Core rules** and **conventions** (the next two blocks) come from the architectureOS repo and are
  the same in every project built from it. To change one, change it there (core rule 12).
- **Core rules not used here** (in the project rules) lists any core rule this project can't use,
  with the reason. Skip only those, and only while the reason holds. A rule that seems not to fit
  but isn't listed still applies: ask the person rather than skip it.
- **Project rules** (at the bottom) belong to this project. Write each one in three parts: when it
  fires (a table of triggers), how to do it (files, commands), and a decision shortcut for the
  usual edge cases. Give non-obvious rules a date and who decided ("owner decision, 2026-11-07").
- **Background:** each rule names a doc in the architectureOS repo (`source_repo` in
  `.governance-sync.json`). It's private; read a doc with
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/docs/<name>.md -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"`.

## Core rules

### 1. Check what exists before building new surface

- **Fires on:** a new page or route, screen, top-level command, permission or role, or menu entry.
  **Not on:** a bug fix, a refactor, or a column, filter or action on an existing page.
- **Do:** run the `feature-fit` skill before building. Write down the need, search what already
  exists, show the person a fit matrix and a verdict (use as-is, extend, or new), and save a
  one-page note in `docs/feature-fit/` that names what it adds. The person decides. Two reminders
  catch what you miss: one while you write, one at push (what counts is set in
  `.claude/hooks/reminders.config.json`).
- **Shortcut:** people can already do it in a few steps → document how, don't build. It's an
  existing page's job with one more column, filter or action → extend that page. Otherwise build
  new, and say why in one sentence.
- Doc: `check-before-building.md`.

### 2. Docs change in the same commit as the code they describe

- **Fires on:** a change to what people do or see, a business rule, a permission, an endpoint, a
  data field, or a tracked status.
- **Do:** update the help, starter doc, ledger or decision record that describes it in the same
  commit, so undoing the commit undoes both. If nothing needs updating, say so with a line in the
  commit message: `Docs-Impact: none - <why>`.
- Doc: `same-commit.md`.

### 3. Answer a reminder with a reason a reviewer can read

- **Fires on:** a reminder (a hook, a check, a skill step) that applies to your change, when you
  decide no action is needed.
- **Do:** add a line at the end of the commit message, `<Check>: none - <reason>`, for example
  `Feature-Fit: none - settings screen, not a new feature` or `Docs-Impact: none - styling only`.
  Write the reason for a reviewer. Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`) instead.
- Doc: `commit-trailers.md`.

### 4. Cite where behavior comes from

- **Fires on:** code that implements a requirement from somewhere else: a spec, an issue, a system
  being replaced, a person's decision.
- **Do:** name the source in a comment next to it: `// Source: <reference>` (a spec section, an
  issue, `oldapp/orders.py:120-140`, "owner decision, 2026-11-04"). A file that ports one source
  file says so at the top: `// Source-File: <path>`.
- Doc: `provenance-markers.md`.

### 5. Don't invent rules

- **Fires on:** adding a validation, a permission check, a status rule, a limit or a default.
- **Do:** every one traces to a source (rule 4). If one is genuinely needed but has no source, mark
  it `// invented: <why>` and list it in the PR for a person to approve. Before changing code to
  match a doc, check the doc against the source: docs go stale.
- Doc: `no-invented-rules.md`.

### 6. Trust order when sources disagree

The source itself (the running system, the spec, the authoritative data file) wins, then current
code, then docs and ledgers, then memory of past sessions. Fix the lower one to match the higher
one. Fix stale docs you come across while working in that area, in the same commit; don't start a
mass rewrite. Before recommending a file, function or flag you remember, check it still exists.
Doc: `trust-order.md`.

### 7. Record non-obvious decisions

- **Fires on:** a choice a reasonable person could have made the other way, one that is expensive
  to reverse, or one that makes code look surprising.
- **Do:** add `docs/decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md` from `docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md`. Reversing a
  decision means a new record that supersedes the old one; never edit the old one.
- Doc: `decision-records.md`.

### 8. Analyze code structure with a parser, not text matching

- **Fires on:** a script, audit or codemod that decides something from code structure (what calls
  what, which attributes a class has, which routes exist).
- **Do:** use the language's parser or compiler API (TypeScript compiler API, Roslyn, Python
  `ast`). Regex and string search are fine for logs, prose, non-code files, reminders that only
  nudge, and narrowing down which files to parse, never for the final decision.
- Doc: `analyze-with-a-parser.md`.

### 9. Access is enforced on the server, and widened only with a source

- **Fires on:** a permission check, a role, a sharing or visibility rule, an endpoint that reads or
  changes data, or anything else that changes who can see or do what.
- **Do:**
  - Check access on the server, against the stored record (whose it is, who it's shared with),
    never against an ID, role or owner sent in the request. Checks in the browser only decide what
    to show.
  - Never run SQL or a query built from request text: accept IDs and structured filters.
  - Widening access (more people, more records, fewer checks) cites its source (rule 4) and is
    listed in the PR for the owner to approve. Never undo a security fix to make something work.
- Doc: `access-on-the-server.md`.

### 10. Report each work state as its own fact

- **Fires on:** saying where a change stands: in a report, a PR, a handoff note, an issue.
- **Do:** keep the states apart: **implemented** (the change exists), **verified** (the stated
  check ran and passed, and you saw the result), **accepted** (the person approved it), **merged**
  (it's on the target branch), **released** (users or the target environment have it). Never infer
  a later state from an earlier one: a passing build isn't a release, and a check that didn't run
  didn't pass.
- Doc: `work-states.md`.

### 11. Protect user data before changing it destructively

- **Fires on:** a migration, bulk edit, import, cleanup, or anything else that deletes or rewrites
  data people created.
- **Do:** export it first, check the export is complete, and prove the restore works somewhere
  disposable. Check inputs before changing anything, and make the change all-or-nothing so a
  failure leaves no partial state. Ask the person before running it on real data.
- Doc: `user-data-safety.md`.

### 12. Keep governance in step with architectureOS

Run `/sync-governance` now and then; it updates the governance blocks, skills, hooks and
templates. To improve a core rule, a skill or a template, change it in the architectureOS repo so
every project gets it, not only here. Doc: `keeping-projects-in-sync.md`.

<!-- BEGIN governance:conventions -->
## Conventions

- **Every project states its lifecycle stage**: experiment, project, maintained, product or
  archived (in the project rules and the README). An experiment is labeled as one and makes no
  production claims. Moving up a stage is a decision the person makes, not a reward for
  accumulating code; a stage brings only the controls its risk needs.
- **Boring, replaceable technology.** Prefer what the next person can understand, run and replace.
  No shared infrastructure, service or library until a second real user of it exists. Settle who
  owns a piece of data or behavior before splitting it into another service or repo.
- **Every repo's README** says what the repo owns, its lifecycle stage, how to run or use it, and
  where its guidance lives.
- **Small, reversible steps.** Prefer a reviewable increment with a way back over a sweeping
  change; keep existing users of a thing working until its replacement is proven.
- **Never start or re-run a deploy or CI workflow** without an explicit go for that run. When asked
  whether something is reachable or allowed, check with read-only calls and run nothing.
- **Test data in a sandbox** (an environment the project rules name as safe for testing) is fine
  without asking: label test records TEST, and say afterwards what was done. Anything shared or
  live goes through the person first.
- **People's data stays where it lives.** Users' personal data never goes into commits, PR
  descriptions, issues, logs, test data or screenshots, nor into any service the project doesn't
  already trust with it. Logs mask identifying values.
- **Secrets never go in git.** Passwords, keys, tokens and connection strings stay in the
  environment or a secrets store; committed config holds placeholders. If one is committed, tell
  the person at once: rotating it matters more than rewriting history.
- **Sample data is invented.** Mockups, demo data and fixtures use made-up people and places,
  checked against real records for accidental matches.

## Project rules

<!-- This section is the project's. Fill it in; delete this comment once real rules are here. -->

### About this project

- What it owns:
- Lifecycle stage (experiment, project, maintained, product, archived):

### Core rules not used here

- None. List a core rule only when it can't apply to this project, with the reason, for example
  `9 (access on the server): static files, no server`. Delete the line once the reason stops being true.

### Commands

- Install:
- Run locally:
- Tests, type check, lint (wrap-up runs these):
- Push reminder, once per clone: `node .claude/hooks/push-reminder.mjs --install`

### Environments

- Sandbox for testing:
- Live, and who changes it:

### Branches, review and release

- PRs go to (target branch):
- Branch names (default `feature/<short-name>`):
- Bring a branch up to date by (merge or rebase):
- Reviewer: with no second reviewer, the person reviews the whole diff themselves before it merges.
- How changes reach users, and who runs it:

### Where things live (feature-fit searches these)

- Pages and navigation:
- Help or user docs:
- Starter docs:
- API endpoints:

### Commit-message answers this project uses

- `Feature-Fit: none - <reason>` and `Docs-Impact: none - <reason>` (core rules 1 to 3). Add any of
  the project's own here, with the check that reads them.
